# Challenge 4 â€” Ping Me ðŸ“²

A multiâ€‘tier Twilio SMS project built in Python, progressing from a simple CLI to a web UI.  
All tiers send messages only to your own verified number (Twilio trial restriction).

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- Twilio trial account with a verified number
- ngrok (for exposing local Flask server to Twilio)
- `.env` file with:
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1YOUR_TWILIO_NUMBER
TWILIO_TEST_NUMBER=+1YOUR_VERIFIED_NUMBER
FLASK_DEBUG=true

---

## Setup
1. Clone this repo or download the files.
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Create a `.env` file with your Twilio credentials and numbers.
4. For local CLI testing, run Python scripts directly.  
   For web UI testing, start Flask and ngrok:
   ./dev_server.ps1

## Tierâ€¯2 â€” Custom Message to Self (Web UI)

Description: Extends Tierâ€¯1 by adding a Flask web form to send a custom message.

- Twilio credentials remain serverâ€‘side.
- Works with ngrok for local development and Twilio webhooks.

How to Use:

2. Open the ngrok HTTPS URL (or http://127.0.0.1:5000/) in your browser.
3. Type a message and click Send.
4. Check your phone for the SMS.

Validation Rules:

## Ground Rules Recap
- Only text your own verified number (Twilio trial restriction).
- Store credentials in `.env` â€” never hardcode.
- Donâ€™t log full tokens.
- Trial messages include Twilioâ€™s trial banner â€” thatâ€™s fine.
