routes/inbound.py
-----------------
Flask Blueprint for handling inbound SMS messages from Twilio.

When Twilio receives an SMS on your configured number, it sends an HTTP POST
request to your webhook endpoint (e.g., /sms). This route:
- Logs the incoming message to the console for local dev visibility.
- Sends a simple echo reply back to the sender using Twilio's TwiML.

This module is registered in your Flask app so it becomes part of the running server.
