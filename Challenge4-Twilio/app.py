Main Flask application entrypoint.

Responsibilities:
- Load environment variables from .env into the process environment.
- Create and configure the Flask app instance.
- Register route Blueprints (e.g., inbound SMS handler).
- Start the development server (used locally with ngrok for Twilio webhooks).
