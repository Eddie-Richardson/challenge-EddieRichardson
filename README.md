# Challenge Portfolio â€“ Eddie Richardson

This is my personal portfolio repository, automatically synced every Sunday at 4â€¯AM EST from the **Coding United Club**, an official Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) organization.

![Sync from Club Repo](https://github.com/Eddie-Richardson/challenge-EddieRichardson/actions/workflows/sync.yml/badge.svg)

## Branch Structure

- **workflow** (default branch): contains only the GitHub Action that keeps this repo in sync.  
- **challengeX-tierY** branches: contain the actual challenge code.  
  - Example: `challenge4-tier1`, `challenge4-tier2`, `challenge4-tier3`  
  - Future challenges will follow the same pattern: `challenge5-tier1`, `challenge5-tier2`, etc.

Each tier branch represents a progressively more advanced version of the same challenge.

## How to Browse

- Start with the lowest tier branch (e.g. `challenge4-tier1`) to see the baseline solution.  
- Move up through `tier2` and `tier3` to see progressively more advanced implementations.  
- Each challenge is isolated by branch naming, so you can check out any `challengeX-tierY` branch directly.

## ðŸ“š Challenge Index

Below is a growing index of challenges completed as part of the **Coding United Club**, an official Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) organization.  
Each challenge branch demonstrates progressively more advanced solutions, with the tech stack noted for quick reference.

Challenges are listed in numerical order as theyâ€™re released by the club.

ðŸ”Ž Each branch contains its own README with detailed documentation, implementation notes, and future plans.


### Challenge 4 â€“ Twilio (Python CLI, Flask web app, Mobile app planned, Twilio API)
***Theme: Build a tiny messaging sender in escalating tiers.***

- [Tier 1](https://github.com/Eddie-Richardson/challenge-EddieRichardson/tree/challenge4-tier1) â€“ A simple Python CLI that sends a fixed SMS to your own verified number using Twilio.
- [Tier 2](https://github.com/Eddie-Richardson/challenge-EddieRichardson/tree/challenge4-tier2) â€“ Extends Tierâ€¯1 by adding a Flask web form to send a custom message.
- [Tier 3](https://github.com/Eddie-Richardson/challenge-EddieRichardson/tree/challenge4-tier3) â€“ Work in progress: currently a clone of Tierâ€¯2, planned to become a mobile app that interacts with the Flask web service.
